    <h2>4. Processing of personal data and other data by LevelApp</h2>
    <h4>4.1	Information we automatically collect when you use LevelApp</h4>
    We do not collect personal data when you visit the website because the IP address is cut during the tracking process.
    <h4>4.2	Information you provide by intentionally contacting us</h4>
    We offer a contact form on our website. LevelApp will store the personal data provided by you when you send the completed contact form (e.g. name, address, telephone number, e-mail address) in its Customer Relationship Management System („CRM System“). LevelApp will use such personal data to respond to your contact request;
    in anonymized form to support our internal business objectives, namely data analyses, revisions, the development of new products, improvement of this internet presence, improvement of our services, detection of usage trends and determination of the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns;
    in order to prevent and identify abuse or fraud.
    The data collected via the contact form will not be forwarded to third parties.
    <h4>4.3	Transfer of your personal data</h4>
    We use your personal data only for the identified purposes and within the scope necessary for achieving these purposes. Transfer will only take place (if at all) with the statutory requirements. Transfers to public authorities and administrative bodies only take place within the scope of mandatory national legal provisions or if it is necessary in cases of abuse or fraud activities for civil and criminal enforcement. Transfer for other purposes – in particular for purposes of address dealing – is excluded.
    <h4>4.4	Information on Web Analysis Tools</h4>
    <h6>4.4.1 Google Tag Manager</h6>
    This LevelApp website will use the Google Tag Manager. Google Tag Manager is a solution enabling marketers to administer Website Tags on an interface. The tool Tag Manager itself (which implements the tags) is a cookie-less domain and does not collect personal data. The tool triggers the below described other tags which themselves may collect data, as described below. Google Tag Manager does not access these data. If a deactivation has been carried out on domain or cookie level, it remains for all tracking tags implemented with the Google Tag Manager.<br/>
    <h6>4.4.2 Google Analytics</h6>
    This LevelApp website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your computer and make it possible to analyse how you utilize the site. The information generated by the cookie (including the IP address) is transferred and stored on a Google server located in the United States.
    Google uses the information on our behalf to evaluate how this LevelApp website is used, create reports about the activities on the site for the site operators, and to perform additional services regarding website and internet utilization. Further, Google may pass this data on to third parties, if required by law or if using their services to analyse this data. Google will not associate IP addresses with any other information held by Google.

    <h6>4.4.3 Google AdWords</h6>
    We will use the so-called Conversion Tracking from Google AdWords. Google AdWords is an online advertising program of Google Inc. If you click on advertising placed by Google, a cookie for the Conversion Tracking is placed on your device. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and contain no personal data and therefore do not serve identification. If you visit certain websites within the 30-day-validity, Google can recognize that you clicked on the advertisement and that you have been forwarded to our website. Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. The information collected with the aid of the Conversion cookie serves the purpose of creating Conversion statistics for AdWords customers that have decided to use Conversion Tracking. Thereby Google AdWords customers find out the total number of users that have clicked on their advertisement and have been forwarded to their website. However, they do not receive any information that can personally identify a user.
    You can disable the storing of cookies in the settings options at Google (“Google Ad Settings”) using this link. Furthermore, you can make use of the deactivation options available at Network Advertising Initiative under this link.

    Furthermore, within the Google AdWords services we will use the remarketing functions “Google Remarketing for Search” and “Google Display Network Remarketing”. These remarketing reports are used within Google Analytics. Should you wish to opt out of this then please see this link.
    “Google Remarketing for Search” and “Google Display Network Remarketing” display relevant ads tailored to you based on the fact that you visited our website by placing a cookie on your machine. The cookie is used to say “This person visited this page, so show them ads relating to that page.” It allows us to tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and only display ads that are relevant to you.

    This LevelApp website will use the pixel function of Facebook Custom Audience. The Facebook Pixel is offered by the social network Facebook. Facebook is registered in Europe as Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.
    The Facebook Pixel is integrated into this LevelApp website with an “advanced matching” function. The pixel initiates the processing of personal data by Facebook and enables the identification of users via numerous websites. This tracking procedure allows target group-oriented advertising.
    The Facebook Pixel stores a cookie, which is a tiny text file, on your device when you access our LevelApp website. If you are logged in to Facebook at the same time or subsequently log in to Facebook, the visit of this this website will be noted in your Facebook profile. That information is stored and processed by Facebook so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and can be used for market research and advertising purposes.
