    The Blockchain Services
    LevelApp Application facilitates the submission of Virtual Currency transaction data to the relevant Virtual Currency blockchain network without requiring you to download or install the associated Virtual Currency network software to your local device.
    Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Virtual Currency transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency public ledger associated with the relevant Virtual Currency network.

We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before completing them via the Services.
    No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been submitted to the Virtual Currency network via the Services, the Services cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction details. LevelApp has no control over any Virtual Currency network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.<br/>
    Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you for which you have submitted transaction details via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that LevelApp is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Virtual Currency transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any Virtual Currency transactions.<br/><br/>
